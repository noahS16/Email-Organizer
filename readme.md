# Simplified Gmail Viewer/Organizer #

This is a **Desktop App** that I made using python and the Gmail API to make organizing and/or cleaning out
your inboxes not only easier, but faster as well. This app is especially useful to users with thousands of emails, 
as you can now delete sender specific emails AND unsubscribe from those senders in a single click.

## Functionality
* Main functionality of the program includes:
    * View your emails by sender, like a common text or instant messaging layout.
    * Delete OR Trash all messages that are form the sender you select with a single click. 
    * View messages individually, so you can be more specific in which ones you would like to get rid of. 
    * Unsubscribe - will open an unsubscribe link from the sender you choose in your browser.
